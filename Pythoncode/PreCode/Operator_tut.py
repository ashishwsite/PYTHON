######BITWISE OPRATOR IN PYTHON
# Examples of Bitwise operators
a = 10
b = 4
# Print bitwise AND operation
print(a & b)
# Print bitwise OR operation
print(a | b)
# Print bitwise NOT operation
print(~a)
# print bitwise XOR operation
print(a ^ b)
# print bitwise right shift operation
print(a >> 2)

# print bitwise left shift operation
print(a << 2)


#######LOGICAL OPERATOR 
# Examples of Logical Operator
a = True
b = False
# Print a and b is False
print(a and b)

# Print a or b is True
print(a or b)

# Print not a is False
print(not a)
